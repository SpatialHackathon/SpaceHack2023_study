Instruction:

* All the cluster sweeping result, spatial coordinates and GT labels of each datasets are stored in the `combined_results.tsv` in the respective dataset folder. The base clustering results are named in the format of `<method>_<nclust>`. And only default configurations are used.

* `label_ARI.tsv` stores all the ARI results for each results instance against GT labels. 

Both ARI results and clustering results were generated via the pipeline and the specific code is omitted in this folder.
